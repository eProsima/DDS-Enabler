API Reference
=============

This section provides the *eProsima DDS Enabler* C++ API reference.
*eProsima DDS Enabler* is a modular middleware solution enabling seamless integration between distributed systems
by building on top of the DDS standard. It allows developers to create scalable, reliable, and real-time communication
infrastructures with minimal effort.

As part of the ARISE project, DDS Enabler facilitates OT/IT convergence by bridging robotic (ROS 2) and NGSI-LD context
brokers, enabling a unified communication framework for industrial environments. Its foundation on Fast DDS guarantees
low-latency, high-performance capabilities suitable for critical human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios.

The following pages document the classes, functions, and types exposed by *DDS Enabler*:
