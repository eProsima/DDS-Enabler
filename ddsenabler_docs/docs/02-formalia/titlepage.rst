**eProsima DDS Enabler** is a modular middleware framework that connects DDS networks with an external system or data platform, delivering real-time, bidirectional interoperability.
It orchestrates all necessary DDS participants, auto-discovers topics and types, and flexibly translates DDS samples into your target data model â€” and routes incoming context updates or events back into DDS topics.
